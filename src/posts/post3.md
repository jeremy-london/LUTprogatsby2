# Dash for Cash pig show comes to Perry

Pigs and their trainers were out at a hog show at the Georgia National Fairgrounds Saturday morning.

Kids in pre-k to seniors in college came out to show off their swine in the 1st annual Dash for Cash Pig Show.

Over 200 pigs were judged on body fat, muscle mass and how the trainer presents the pig.

Jaci Underwood, 13, says she's been showing pigs since she was two years old and remembers back to her earliest days in the ring.

"When I was little I had a pig and the judge wasn't looking at me and I ran the pig between the judges legs and it was so bad," she laughs.

Well she's come a long way, winning her class on Saturday with her piggy Bo.

The winners will split a \$10,000 jackpot prize.
